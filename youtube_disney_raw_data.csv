For centuries, the greatest sailors in the world masterfully navigated the vast Pacific, discovering the many islands of Oceania. But then, 3,000 years ago, their voyages stopped for a millennium ‚Äì and no one knows exactly why. From Walt Disney Animation Studios comes ‚ÄúMoana,‚Äù a sweeping, CG-animated feature film about an adventurous teenager who is inspired to leave the safety and security of her island on a daring journey to save her people. Inexplicably drawn to the ocean, Moana (voice of Auli ªi Cravalho) convinces the mighty demigod Maui (voice of Dwayne Johnson) to join her mission, and he reluctantly helps her become a wayfinder like her ancestors who sailed before her. Together, they voyage across the open ocean on an action-packed adventure, encountering enormous monsters and impossible odds, and along the way, Moana fulfills her quest and discovers the one thing she‚Äôs always sought: her own identity. Directed by the renowned filmmaking team of Ron Clements and John Musker (‚ÄúThe Little Mermaid,‚Äù ‚ÄúAladdin,‚Äù ‚ÄúThe Princess & the Frog‚Äù), produced by Osnat Shurer (‚ÄúLifted,‚Äù ‚ÄúOne Man Band‚Äù), and featuring music by Lin-Manuel Miranda, Mark Mancina and Opetaia Foa‚Äòi, ‚ÄúMoana‚Äù sailed into U.S. theaters on Nov. 23, 2016.

For centuries, the greatest sailors in the world masterfully navigated the vast Pacific, discovering the many islands of Oceania. But then, 3,000 years ago, their voyages stopped for a millennium ‚Äì and no one knows exactly why. From Walt Disney Animation Studios comes ‚ÄúMoana,‚Äù a sweeping, CG-animated feature film about an adventurous teenager who is inspired to leave the safety and security of her island on a daring journey to save her people. Inexplicably drawn to the ocean, Moana (voice of Auli ªi Cravalho) convinces the mighty demigod Maui (voice of Dwayne Johnson) to join her mission, and he reluctantly helps her become a wayfinder like her ancestors who sailed before her. Together, they voyage across the open ocean on an action-packed adventure, encountering enormous monsters and impossible odds, and along the way, Moana fulfills her quest and discovers the one thing she‚Äôs always sought: her own identity. Directed by the renowned filmmaking team of Ron Clements and John Musker (‚ÄúThe Little Mermaid,‚Äù ‚ÄúAladdin,‚Äù ‚ÄúThe Princess & the Frog‚Äù), produced by Osnat Shurer (‚ÄúLifted,‚Äù ‚ÄúOne Man Band‚Äù), and featuring music by Lin-Manuel Miranda, Mark Mancina and Opetaia Foa‚Äòi, ‚ÄúMoana‚Äù sailed into U.S. theaters on Nov. 23, 2016.

For centuries, the greatest sailors in the world masterfully navigated the vast Pacific, discovering the many islands of Oceania. But then, 3,000 years ago, their voyages stopped for a millennium ‚Äì and no one knows exactly why. From Walt Disney Animation Studios comes ‚ÄúMoana,‚Äù a sweeping, CG-animated feature film about an adventurous teenager who is inspired to leave the safety and security of her island on a daring journey to save her people. Inexplicably drawn to the ocean, Moana (voice of Auli ªi Cravalho) convinces the mighty demigod Maui (voice of Dwayne Johnson) to join her mission, and he reluctantly helps her become a wayfinder like her ancestors who sailed before her. Together, they voyage across the open ocean on an action-packed adventure, encountering enormous monsters and impossible odds, and along the way, Moana fulfills her quest and discovers the one thing she‚Äôs always sought: her own identity. Directed by the renowned filmmaking team of Ron Clements and John Musker (‚ÄúThe Little Mermaid,‚Äù ‚ÄúAladdin,‚Äù ‚ÄúThe Princess & the Frog‚Äù), produced by Osnat Shurer (‚ÄúLifted,‚Äù ‚ÄúOne Man Band‚Äù), and featuring music by Lin-Manuel Miranda, Mark Mancina and Opetaia Foa‚Äòi, ‚ÄúMoana‚Äù sailed into U.S. theaters on Nov. 23, 2016.
